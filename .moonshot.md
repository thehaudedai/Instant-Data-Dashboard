### Day 0 (⏱️ )
`October 29, 2025`
- Working on Row Deleting
- Changed Everything in one single page to multiple tabs

💭: Well I was trying to make the row deleting very efficient, so I looked into making a checkbox appear in the dataframe so user can select which to delete from the dataframe, it didn't work, couldn't interact with the data. SO I looked into the documentation and found out theres a thing called `st.data_editor()` which allows the user can edit values, add/delete rows and so more. SO Now I have to redo some parts of the application because using this so many of the stuff can be done easily at once.
