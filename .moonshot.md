### 🔁 Streak 2 ()

### Day 1 (⏱️ 2h 44m 14s)
`October 29, 2025`
- Working on Row Deleting
- Changed Everything in one single page to multiple tabs
- Added Data Type Changing
- Well there are many bugs, that needs fixing now.

💭: Well I was trying to make the row deleting very efficient, so I looked into making a checkbox appear in the dataframe so user can select which to delete from the dataframe, it didn't work, couldn't interact with the data. SO I looked into the documentation and found out theres a thing called `st.data_editor()` which allows the user can edit values, add/delete rows and so more. SO Now I have to redo some parts of the application because using this so many of the stuff can be done easily at once.
💭: I tried making so many changes today, not meaningful features but rather changes to the layout, and during that process I have encountered new ways to do stuff and also by having new ways I have created some redundant code that needs fixing as well as some bugs and rerun issues that will need solving before I can move onto the next one.
💭: I would like the page, to have a skeleton so when nothing is selected or when the user hasn't uploaded the files yet, the pages should show a skeleton of the stuff that could be done and for that I should find a way to properly show the tables, text and all other stuff without raising any errors, especially when `selected_df` is none at times or when there may or may not be `session_state` values all the time.

### Day 2 (⏱️ 1h 9m 5s)
`October 30, 2025`
- Added Bookmarks Using `Bookmark` extension
- Debugging Session (many small changes and fixes rather than individual features)
- Added the structure for column creation

💭: First Log of Today, Thoughts are: I am going to work like 1 hr, its nighttime already and I got to work at today for some time. Going to start by trying to fix the skeleton loading kinda feature, not exactly that but will now from starting look where the `selected_df` should be checked before rendering and all that stuff, including where stuff typically breaks, starting from the very first.
💭: I added in bookmarks using the bookmark extension in VS Code. Finally I can simply go to the exact place I wanna go and see whats happening there without scrolling all the way through dn getting lost+confused+overwhelmed. Also now the skeleton loads without causing any errors
💭: Next thing I wanna do is, in the data editor when you make edits it doenst actually reflect rather is simply there, what I wann do is make a helper function that gets all the edits from the session state key of the data editor i.e. `data_edit_{selected_file}` and in the helper function in `manipulation.py` checks and update only the fields and rows affected and not just the entire dataframe.
💭: First thing to do tomorrow is to make the data editor working like I mentioned above. Second task would be `Column Creation`, where you: `Name Your Column` -> `Fill With Values` or `Use Some Formulas` (will need to think of a way to do it), and `Button` to actually create the column.
Maybe show some of the rows in a list/dataframe before creating
